This "1" folder is unique to your Instance #1.



After creating a bot account within Instance #1, you should have a .xml file saved in this folder with the username \& password saved inside.



You can manually load these accounts via \_injectAccount.ahk script in /Accounts/.



You can redistribute the .xml account save files amongst your instances via "Balance XMLs".
